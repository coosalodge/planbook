## SR-9 Indian Winter



## Lodge Training Summit & Winter Banquet

In the past, Coosa Lodge has held either a day-long training event (traditionally known as the “Lodge Leadership Development Conference”, or “LLDC”) or a Winter Banquet program.  For the last several years, we’ve combined those ideas into a single day-long event with training and fellowship during the day followed by a great dinner and our successful winter banquet program.

## Hawk Days

One of the Order of the Arrow’s primary functions is to provide service to each council and its camps. During Hawk Day (also sometimes known as “Beaver Day”), Coosa Lodge comes together at one of our local camps to provide a day of focused efforts to provide service and improve the camp.

## Spring Pow-wow

This is one of our most popular events, building on the success of the American Indian Seminar and opening it a wider audience.  Coosa Lodge will set the stage and prepare an exciting program that gives our members opportunities to learn about and participate in Native American drumming, singing, and dancing while introducing Coosa Lodge and the Order of the Arrow to a wider Scouting audience, including Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts who are not yet members of the Order of the Arrow.

## SR-9 Conclave

Each spring, at a nearby Scout camp, the Lodges of our Section meet at an annual Conclave. For many, this is the largest Scouting function they will attend this year. Hundreds of people will be there from eleven different lodges. For more info, stay tuned to http://coosa50.org/.

## Ordeal Weekends

This is the centerpiece of the Inductions Process, and it’s where Ordeal Candidates go through the process of becoming Ordeal Members.

This is a life-enriching experience for everyone who goes through it and it’s one that we work hard to make meaningful, but we need your help!  Whether you work in the kitchen, serve as an Elangomat, work alongside one of the work crews, or find another way to be useful, this is one of the most important opportunities for our lodge to provide cheerful service to our council’s camps.  If you have a specialized skill (plumbing, electrical, etc.), please let us know!

If you have been an Ordeal member for 10 months or longer, you are eligible to attain Brotherhood.  There is no charge for this, but you must download and study the latest update to the Brotherhood Study Guide, available on the lodge website.  You can find much of the same information on the Order of the Arrow JumpStart page at http://jumpstart.oa-bsa.org/.

## Fall Fellowship

Each fall, Coosa Lodge meets at a Greater Alabama Council Camp for its annual Fall Fellowship. This is generally regarded as the biggest event of the year, where we celebrate our accomplishments from the previous year, induct our new Vigil Honor recipients, elect new lodge officers, and lay out our plans for the upcoming year.

You can expect to see inter-Chapter competitions in a variety of games (including volleyball, flickerball, wischixin, and more!), plenty of patch trading, great food, tons of fellowship, and an exciting closing show from Coosa Shows.

## Lodge Leadership Retreat

Shortly after Fall Fellowship, the newly elected Lodge Officers, newly elected Chapter Chiefs, newly appointed Committee Chairmen, all of their advisers, and select others all gather in a secluded location for an intense weekend of training, team building, leadership development, and fellowship. If you’re elected or appointed to a leadership position, you’re expected to attend this event.
