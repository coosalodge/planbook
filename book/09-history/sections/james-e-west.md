## James E. West Fellowship Award

The James E. West Fellowship Award is a national recognition for individuals who contribute $1,000 or more in cash or securities to their local council endowment trust fund. This contribution is in addition to, and does not diminish or replace, the donor's annual gift to the council's Sustaining Membership Enrollment or Friends of Scouting Campaign.

Organizations or individuals may contribute an award in honor of someone--an Eagle Scout, a Silver Beaver recipient, council president, or district chairman, or in memory of a departed loved one, business associate, Scout or Scouter.

The James E. West Fellowship Award is an attractive 8-by-10-inch certificate, personalized with the donor's name, date of gift, and council name. In addition, there will be a distinctive lapel pin/charm and an embroidered square knot for uniform wear. While it is a national recognition, the James E. West Fellowship award is authorized and presented by the local council. Appropriate national recognition will be given at a special reception held in conjunction with the National Annual Meeting.

The award is named after the first Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America who exemplified Ralph Waldo Emerson's observation that "an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man." Scouting today is the "lengthened shadow" of more than three decades of the farseeing and dedicated leadership of Dr. James E. West.

Those who are recognized by the James E. West Fellowship Award will cast their own "lengthened shadow" as they help ensure the Scouting legacy for future generations of young people and create the financial stability of the program in the twenty-first century for their local council.

Coosa Lodge presents these Fellowships to Arrowmen who have spent countless hours further the ideals of the Order of the Arrow. The award is given as often as is deemed appropriate.
