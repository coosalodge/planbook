# National Order of the Arrow Programs

## NEXT: A New Century

NEXT: A New Century will take place July 30 through August 3. The lodge chief, two youth change agents and two adult advisers from each lodge will be invited to attend. Each section will also receive three invitations.

The main objective of NEXT is to create a culture of growth in the Order of the Arrow. Today, we serve about 11% of the youth registered in Boy Scouting. Every lodge has the opportunity to deliver the impact of the OA program to a lot more young people, and give them the same life-changing experience each of us has had.

This past year was about celebrating a century of service but our centennial slogan always implied more was coming NEXT. This summer, weâ€™re going to look at some of the information we have available to us and pivot to our future with one question in mind: What makes a young person become, and remain, a member of the Order of the Arrow?

## Operation Arrow

After a record-setting national conference in 2015, the Order of the Arrow will again seek to make history with Operation Arrow at the 2017 National Scout Jamboree.

To continue a tradition that dates back to the 1950 National Scout Jamboree, over 750 youth Arrowmen will answer the call to serve as part of Operation Arrow - the largest jamboree staff team ever assembled by the Order of the Arrow!

Operation Arrow staff members will support the jamboree program by joining one of three primary OA program areas: the Service Corps, the Trek Guides and the Indian Village.

## National Order of the Arrow Conference

The National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) is the premier event of the Order of the Arrow. It is Scouting's second-largest national program event. Over 8,000 Arrowmen from across our nation gather for an inspirational and unforgettable experience full of fellowship, training, adventure, and lots of fun! 

The 2018 National Order of the Arrow Conference will be held at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. The last time the conference was held on the campus of Indiana University was in 2009.

## National Leadership Seminar

The National Leadership Seminar (NLS) is a weekend training program focusing on leadership development. Run by the Region Chief and his Advisers, it provides an in-depth look at leadership skills and techniques. An NLS discusses how these skills can be applied in your role in the OA and in other aspects of your life.

Each region runs their own NLS program, so detailed information on upcoming NLS sessions is usually available on the Southern Region web site (http://southern.oa-bsa.org/). If you are interested in attending an NLS, please contact your Lodge Chief or Adviser for registration information.

## National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar

The National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS) is a weekend conference focusing on the skills and attributes of effective lodge advisers. It is intended primarily to enhance an adviser's knowledge of and connectivity with the OA's strategic plan, program and resources, while emphasizing personal skills that are essential to the development of effective youth leadership and ultimately the OA's service to the council.

The NLATS session is a brand new training program. The course is designed for one-time participation. Each Region offers at least one NLATS each year. There is also a session offered at the Philmont training center each summer.

It is recommended that participants be lodge advisers or staff advisers and those with lodge adviser potential, as approved by the local council Scout executive. Prior completion of a Lodge Leader Development Conference (LLDC) and the National Leadership Seminar (NLS) are desirable. The NLATS is an intensive experience in learning about the nature of lodge program, delivery of service to the council, and development of youth leadership necessary to both. While it is designed to be fun, the course is mentally challenging as well. Participants should be open to learning and prepared to actively engage in an invigorating weekend.
