## Welcome to the Coosa Lodge Planbook
This is the basis for the Coosa Lodge Planbook.

## Contributing

The process for contributing additions and corrections is still TBD. 

If you are interested in joining the project, contact [Chris Brightwell](https://github.com/chrisbrightwell).

## How to Generate the Book

The configuration files and procedures for generating this book still need to be developed, but the project will utilize `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf`, and `asciidoctor-epub` to convert plaintext files to various formats for print and/or distribution.
